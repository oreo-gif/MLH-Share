    <div  id="tribute-info"><p class="info">Approximately 100 million plastic bottles are used and discarded every day, with 80% of them simply becoming non-biodegradable litter. While it is convenient to consume drinks straight out of plastic bottles, the trash that is accumulated in the process takes a huge toll on the health of our environment. Plastic water bottles have a significant carbon footprint, with the amount of water going into making a bottle being up to three times what’s inside the bottle. Also, bottles used to package water take over 1,000 years to bio-degrade and, if incinerated, produce toxic fumes.

Since reuse is a step up from recycling, repurposing plastic bottles we already have is an excellent habit to get into if we want to do our share to help save the environment. You will be surprised at how many opportunities for reuse there really are – once you start looking for them.

So when you’re done with that plastic drink bottle, don’t just throw it away, use it to make something awesome. Check out these 20 low cost, creative and functional craft projects that will transform the humble plastic bottle into everything from useful storage to great home decor.</p>
